# snakeC : What is this repository about?

This repository is created to store the developing game of snake that was first developed for the Blokade arcade game machine in 1976 in the US. This version of the Snake game is an exercize for me. This version is developed in C programming language and as an IDE is used the Linux VI. The operating system on which is developed this game is CentOS, a version of Linux.

# Warnings

Although my project is licensed in some way, I don't make this game is order to sell it on the market. It is just as a personal project.
