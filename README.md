# Snake : What about that project?

This project aims to recreate in Linux: CentOS -text mode, the Snake game from the 1976 arcade game Blockade. The programming language for this project is C.

# Warning 

This version of snake is not produced for market. 
It is my exercise in the C language in CentOS - text mode operating system.
